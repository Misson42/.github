- The Mission
- Hevy-D
- Puter
- MoneyTree

## The Mission of The Ark is to Free Humans from current worldly restraints. Each participants gains a community of people to join in which we stimulate an environment where we can continue to help Humans World Wide by creating cutting edge technology, funded by the Money Tree.

### Mission 42 is a plan to help the human race survive long term. Here in only contains Phase 1 of 3 in hopes to gather the initial team. 

### Phase 1 of The Ark includes,

> A full stelf standing Blockchain called `Hevy-D`.
Hevy-D was developed with Basic Human Income as its core attribute

> An Operating System called `Puter`, that will run the Blockchain.
Puter was developed to Protect users Information + Give users access to any and all available resources to proceed in personal projects



### Combined the Money Tree was sprouted.

Money Tree is a process catered to free humans by allowing us to earn bassic income from just using the system as designed. Currently there are 8 different ways each user will be able to generate income, with options still being added. We will discuss the initial 5 branches of Money Tree, after we walk through the 4 initial contained Blockchains



# Hevy-D

NOTE: All Chains use a single P2P Node network that is paired with Puter. 

### Authority Chain 
> This chain is incharge of the network. Auth Tokens are used by the algorithm to select forgers for each chain. Distribution of Auth Tokens described in Doc 2.
### Blockchain 
> This chain holds all Hevy-D transactions on the network, recorded in the Account Model. Forgers are selected based on the amount of Auth Tokens a Node account holds.
### The Aly 
> This chain only contains Data and no Hevy-D. Users create a Post and the Hevy-D is separated and sent to the `Blockchain` and the `Data` remains in `The Aly`
### The Guter 
> Similar to `The Aly`, `The Guter` holds all comments recorded on the network. Again no Hevy-D is actually stored in the Guter, only `Data`

The main concept we will discuss in doc 1 is the Aly and the Guter, which leads into Moontax. 3 attributes the Money Tree uses.

> To begin simply, Hevy-D contains a media tracking system that pays content creators. First, every post generates a unique QR code from the transactions .uuid that is paired with the media (pic, gif, sound, video, text, ect). As users scroll with our app, they can scan the posts integrated QR uuid and interact with the creator directly. For every Post or Comment `MoonTax` is charged to the initializer.. 
(~20% for posts/comments[Moontax] & <1% for Hevy-D transactions[DogeBurner]. 


When a user wants to create a post or comment, they must set their own individual `Hevy-D` price point. (IE if one really wanted to be seen, they could set an astronomically large amount and appear at the top of the feed or comment list). During the interaction with the network, The network returns the individual set amount of `Hevy-D` to the initializer minus `MoonTax`. 

Next the network keeps track of each users total MoonTax spend, where a leaderboard system will display the top ranking, `Dogeburners`, `MoonTax Spenders`, and `Hevy-D Burners`, these attributes are used by the `PAYDAY` algorithm to determine teacher individuals network usage. Further development to create a level playing field is essential for users worldwide and the health of the network. (Some ppl might not have Doge to even get into the network, they will need help)


## MoonTax

### Burn Tax

> First is a set 4.22% that is collected from every post or comment. As the name describes, this amount of Hevy-D is removed from circulation forever.

### Payout Tax

> Second is a function called `PAYDAY`. 16.9% is collected from every post or comment. This collected amount is pooled & paid out to all active users every 42 hours. An algorithm has been designed to payout users according to their `Total Monthly Moontax` spent amount. This accomplishes 2 things, a desire to use the network to compete for higher payouts, and  highest spending accounts are statistically proven to return next month and repeat the process benefiting the total user base.

### Creator Tax

> 4.22 % is subtracted from the 16.9% payout tax when any user comments on a post or another comment. This amount is paid directly to the posts creator, or a % is sent to the posts creator and a % sent to the comments creator driving the quality of the comment or post.

These systems are catered for the user by the user. Moontax and Payout algorithms will be finalized using a `Network Vote` after release. 


## Network Vote

> Included in the Authority chain is a Community Voting system. This system was designed to be a happy medium between the `Network Authorities`, and `Network Users`. When the User or the Authorities would like to see dramatic network changes (% change ect) up to 5 options will be given for the users to vote on. With Dramatic Left & right arguments, as well as a fence line option. Users will then vote by staking their `Auth Tokens` into one of the 3-5 options. After the vote users will de-stake their tokens and Authorities will implement the changes on the next Puter Update. Authorities are Forbidden from voting as they must protect the network while user Tokens are Destaked from the Forger Pool.


# How is Hevy-D created?

[Denarius wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius)


### First To be clear, The Ark is not asking to join or be a part of Dogecoin. The Ark simply drives a major use case that benefits all Dogecoin holders. Dogecoins could become highly valuable like Gold, and Hevy-D has the potential to become Dogecoins Silver (low transaction fees).


> Hevy-D is created when any user burns Dogecoin via the Network API that takes Dogecoins from an internal Hevy-D account (See Puter) and returns a set amount of Hevy-D (final exchange rate to be determined by core team).

### Alone this is not enough to drive and fund a new.. Economy. 

> Paired with Hevy-D is an OS called Puter. When users burn Dogecoin to generate Hevy-D they also gain access to the New. Each user must burn the set amount of Dogecoin per year to continue to access Puters full range of included features and apps. This has a plethora of benefactors for not only the user but also The Ark. Lets get into it by addressing what the user will gain and what The Ark will gain.

## The User

By Burning Dogecoin to access Puter, each user automatically starts generating income from the Money tree. Users are then given full access to Puter, which in short should be the last subscription service any user should have to pay for. Puters plan is to redesign all systems from the ground up, with a few core attributes in mind,

- Protect users information by adding no new personal data to DBâ€™s world wide
- Redesign all applications within one Operating system to address current accessibility issues

## The Ark

### How would The Ark survive?


To start our API will subtract a set 22% of all Dogecoin before being sent to the burn address. Initially this pooled amount will pay developers for their input to the all inclusive OS. Within 4 years from launch, the model outlines that The Ark will be completely self-sufficient without the need for the additional 20%. The Ark will then host an Annual DogeParty once a year where the Additional 20% will be burned in one Event, at a different location world wide, each year.

Hevy-D, Puter, and The Dogecoin community will then have a place to share projects, collaborate with other community members, see the latest Network updates and Businesses released by The Ark, as well as have an amazing good ass time. Tickets fees will also be paid in Dogecoin where all profits will be added to the DogeParty burn pool.

# Puter

> One thing is for sure. When I'm able to create an AI simulated from my last 6 months of brain data, I am NOT storing that on any system that exists today. I want that in my control under my rules and regulations with my own lock and key. Puter will give every user this access.



### Puter can be broken into 6 Categories. 

## PUTER

> `Puter` is the base open source code available to everyone located on `Puters Cloud`. Users are able to download the Puter OS and install it on any current device today. Puter is Software not Hardware. Users will soon shop for a device they want to use and install Puter when they get home vs using the preinstalled OS that came with the device.

## Puter 2 

> `Puter 2` or `PuterBooth` is designed to be downloaded on any old laptop, RaspPi, ect and stored in the basement, closet ect. Puter 2 acts as your mainframe pair with the Hevy-D network. Users have the capability to add old graphic cards, processors, ram, harddrives, ect to not only expand a user's computing power but to supply that hardware to the Puter Cloud if desired(additional payouts included). 

## Puter 3

> `Puter 3` is the first extension of the users system or `PuterBooth`. Puter 3 is a computer OS, downloadable for any existing device. Puter 3 acts as your mobile terminal bridging your data across all puters. Seamlessly.

## Puter 4

> `Puter 4` is an extension that covers Phones. Bridging personal information from Puters 2-6. The benefit of having an all inclusive simultaneous running OS is internal access to processes, file systems ect.

## Puter 5

> `Puter 5` is the OS's extension to cover all external smart devices. Devices could include watches, household appliances and the potential to cover vehicles in the long term. 

## Puter 6

> `Puter 6` will prepare to systematically back up personal data from associated Neuralink type devices. This data will be the most valuable of all. And if i'm going to create a Digital AI copy of myself I want to ensure I own that product on my own device on my own terms.




## How is Puter further different from Microsoft, Apple & Linux?

> Operating systems that exist today were designed to be distributed to the mass market, fast and in bulk. Each system is a cookie cut imprint leaving the user lost in the wind. Puter offers a different starting point. Puter caters to each user specifically. When a user installs Puters, a Base version is given, our designed algorithms will learn how each user behaves on their own systems, and alter systems to your individual needs.  All personal data is then stored on your own PuterBooth that contains all the encryption and data protections services that have been designed by The Ark developers. The best part is that we use the same data protection services that you use. Open sourced, running independently, updated by paid network developers.

# SPAZ

The biggest benefit of Puter is allowing this open sourced private AI access to all your data. Your personal information and data habits will then be paired to our base AI version of Siri or Alexa to create a unique personal experience. 


> 'Hey Spaz, last summer I was visiting my friends at that cabin in the wood do you remember that experience"

> "Yes odd I do, what can I help you with?"

> "I was having a conversation with Joe and he brought up a theory I never heard of before, can you explain it to me again"

> "Yes odd, the conversation was about ~ and in conclusion ~ "


This is the potential of Puter & SPAZ, Puter can record all audio from your devices, documenting all meetings and encounters the user experiences. After all, companies do this already, we just don't have access to said data. With Puter 2, Data storage and privacy is not an issue. Just plug additional unused resources into your home P2 and expand your system processing power & storage space.

Lastly, Puter Aims to be ready to pair with Neuralink like systems before they are released. Puter will already have a unique AI catered to the user, pair that with 6 month worth of Neuralink Brain data could result in a similar version of a personal Cortana. This would solidify our position in the markets. 



## Money Tree

As a result of the aforementioned information, The Money Tree was sprouted. It should be reiterated that the Core concept here is to Free Humans by empowering each individual with this technology. All profits generated by any of The Arks additional undefined businesses (see Doc 2) will be used to self propel The Ark, further benefiting humankind with new tech. 

> The Money Tree plan or concept has been designed solely with each network user in mind. 

> The initial 20% of Collected Dogecoin is to Jumpstart the network, paying developers.


The Doge Plan outlines how to use The Ark for the initial 15 years of the Network. Data will show that if every user was to buy 'x' amount of Dogecoin today and burn 'y' amount every year, that collectively as a community we have the potential to burn the circulating supply of Dogecoin. Raising the World Trade Value of Dogecoin for all Hodlers. We can give any participant financial freedom in under 15 years, while simultaneously paying for Puters development and funding other projects to benefit humans and the earth. 

### The initial described Money Tree Branches include


- The Doge Burner
- Hodling Hevy-D
- MoonTax Payouts
- Creator Tax Payouts
- Puter Cloud Hardware Payout
- .. More defined in Phase 2


## With enough network activity The Ark has the potential to put Doge on a Leash. 

> It should be noted that, Hevy-D and the Money Tree were created as by-products to fund The full mission. Helping Humans. Puter is the system that will hold all future projects created by myself oddfl3x and in hopes to develop your projects as well. Before I could start the real projects I needed somewhere that was safe, and allowed me to connect with other like minded individuals for this is not achievable alone. This is only Phase 1, and the real results will be shown in Phase 2 & 3.


If you would like to join the initial development team please reach on [discord](https://discord.gg/KH9pJgECor) @ me on titter @oddfl3x with something about M42 / Mission42.

Otherwise we will see you upon release. 
Thank you for reading.
